<h1><b>welcome to kathie's webbie (´｡• ω •｡`) ♡</b></h1>

    Hi, I'm <b>Kathie</b>. If you're here then you probably already know the regular stuff about me like I make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@k4th">XMR videos</a> & <a href="https://xmrbazaar.com/user/kafi/">sell stickers</a>. When I'm not doing that, I'm usually studying / procrastinating. <b>I love learning.</b> When I get focused on something, I want to just learn all about it. That's also kind of how I got into Monero. I just kept learning about cryptocurrencies until I reached the one that resonated with me the most. It was the one that remained true to <u>my vision of freedom</u>. ALso idc what anyone else thinks but <b>FREE SAMOURAI</b>!!! :( Genuinely still so upset about this. Always admired his work in BTC and it's such a loss for society that he is not free rn.<p></p>
    
    <b>Hobbies/Interests</b>: 3D printing, arts & crafts, journaling, drawing, Pokemon, video games, anime (HunterxHunter=♡), video editing, technology, XMR<br>

<br><h2>why i make videos</h2>

    I made my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@k4th">video</a> in <b>2021</b>. Back then, there weren't a lot of guides. And for the ones that existed, I found they had a lot of shibboleth that I was unfamilar with. In a way, I started making videos to force myself to learn more. Still, I believe everyone has the right to privacy, so I decided to make videos for an audience that does not know much about Monero but<b> wants to know more</b>. I always try to put my own touch when editing my videos so you might see <i>Marshall from Animal Crossing</i> & other things I like.

<h2>why i make stickers</h2>
When I saw the Monero stickers (esp the one that's like <i>Don't Buy Monero</i>), I realized that irony wasn't for me. Realizing I had free will, <b>I just made my own</b>. I first sketch on paper, then redraw the design in ProCreate. I print, laminate, and cut each one. I also wanted to make stickers that are like ~xmr inconspicuous~ in a way. Like my friends that are not into crypto thought the cat stickers were cute and they're proudly displaying them on their laptops (dw I did tell them it's XMR but they don't really care).
